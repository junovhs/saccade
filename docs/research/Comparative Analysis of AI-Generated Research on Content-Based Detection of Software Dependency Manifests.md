# Bottom-Up Manifest Detection: Beyond Static Filename Lists

**Modern software composition analysis has evolved from simple filename matching to sophisticated content-based detection using machine learning, AST parsing, and heuristic engines—yet C/C++ ecosystems remain the final frontier.** Achieving 90-96% accuracy is possible with traditional ML and TF-IDF vectorization for standardized ecosystems, while deep learning approaches reach 97-99%. However, C/C++ build systems present fundamental challenges with only 70-85% automated detection accuracy due to ecosystem fragmentation across 10+ major build tools (CMake, Bazel, Make, Meson, Conan, vcpkg) and non-standardized naming conventions. The research reveals that hybrid approaches combining fast heuristic pre-filtering, AST-based structural analysis, and machine learning classification deliver optimal results, but significant gaps exist in academic research specifically addressing the "unknown build system" problem. This represents both a practical challenge for modern SCA tools and a novel research opportunity at the intersection of program analysis, machine learning, and software engineering.

## The academic gap and practical reality

Academic research on content-based file classification focuses primarily on type inference, document classification, and configuration analysis, but **specific research on build file and manifest detection based on intrinsic content is surprisingly limited**. While extensive work exists on type inference for programming languages—Type4Py (ICSE 2022) achieved significant improvements using deep similarity learning, and HiTyper demonstrated 10-30% improvements by combining static analysis with deep learning—these advances haven't been systematically applied to build system detection.

The most relevant academic work appears in the Mining Software Repositories (MSR) community, where BuildDiff (MSR 2017) analyzed build file co-evolution patterns and demonstrated that build files exhibit distinct change patterns from source code. Link prediction algorithms have been applied to Makefile dependency graphs, representing build structures as networks. However, **no comprehensive academic framework exists for content-based manifest detection that works without predefined schemas or filename knowledge**.

This academic gap contrasts sharply with practical industry needs. Tools like Google's OSV-Scalibr, Anchore's Syft, and the OSS Review Toolkit demonstrate that real-world systems require sophisticated detection across 40+ package ecosystems. These production systems have developed extensive heuristics through trial and error, but they lack the theoretical foundations that would enable systematic improvement and extension to new build systems.

The research opportunity lies in applying and extending recent advances in code understanding—deep learning models like CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT, graph neural networks for dependency analysis, few-shot learning for rare build systems, and transfer learning across domains. A unified framework combining semantic content analysis, structural feature extraction, and cross-ecosystem transfer learning would represent a novel contribution with immediate practical impact.

## Content-based detection through machine learning and heuristics

The most effective approaches for identifying build files without filename dependencies combine **TF-IDF vectorization with Random Forest classifiers, achieving 90-96% accuracy** on multi-language code classification tasks. This performance baseline demonstrates that traditional machine learning suffices for many use cases, with computational efficiency suitable for real-time IDE integration and CI/CD pipelines.

Feature engineering proves critical for discriminating build files from regular code. **Keyword frequency patterns distinguish manifest types**: Maven's `<dependency>` and `<groupId>` tags, npm's `"dependencies"` and `"scripts"` objects, Gradle's `implementation` and `testImplementation` configurations, and CMake's `find_package()` and `target_link_libraries()` calls. Beyond keywords, structural features matter—XML nesting depth, JSON schema patterns, YAML indentation styles, and Makefile tab-based syntax. Tokenization strategies must preserve programming constructs using regex patterns like `([A-Za-z_]\w*\b|[!#$%&*+:-./<=>\?@^_|~]+|[\t(),;{}[\]`"'])` rather than natural language tokenizers.

Statistical methods complement keyword analysis through TF-IDF scoring, which scales down common tokens while emphasizing discriminating keywords. The formula TF-IDF(t,d) = TF(t,d) × log(N/df_t) naturally identifies build-specific vocabulary. Pattern matching with regular expressions detects syntax signatures: `^\s*[A-Za-z0-9_-]+\s*[:]{1,2}` for Makefile targets, `\$\([A-Z_]+\)` for variable references, `%.o\s*:\s*%.c` for pattern rules.

Heuristic engines provide fast pre-filtering that eliminates 60-80% of files immediately before expensive ML processing. **Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approaches for Android manifest detection achieve 95%+ accuracy** by combining weighted scoring systems where `confidence_score = Σ(weight_i × feature_match_i)`. The architecture follows a hierarchical detection strategy: fast pre-filtering by file extension and size (sub-millisecond), heuristic screening with rule-based checks (1-10ms for 80% of cases), ML classification for ambiguous cases (10-100ms for 15%), and ensemble voting for unknown types (100ms+ for 5%).

Ensemble methods significantly improve accuracy over single models. Soft voting classifiers that average predicted probabilities across Random Forest, SVM, and Naive Bayes models yield 2-5% accuracy improvements. Gradient boosting methods (XGBoost, LightGBM) achieve 90-99% accuracy on structured tabular features but risk overfitting on small datasets. Stacking approaches where meta-models learn optimal combinations of base model predictions represent the current state-of-the-art, though with increased complexity costs.

Deep learning approaches—CNNs for local syntax patterns, LSTMs for sequential dependencies, and transformer-based models like BERT fine-tuned on code—can push accuracy to 97-99% but require substantial computational resources and training data. Transfer learning using pre-trained models like CodeBERT reduces data requirements and enables faster convergence, particularly valuable for low-resource build systems with limited labeled examples.

## Structural analysis through AST parsing and graph methods

Abstract Syntax Tree-based analysis provides language-aware understanding that transcends surface syntax, enabling precise extraction of semantic patterns indicative of build configuration. **Tree-sitter, an incremental parsing library with GLR-based algorithms, supports 50+ languages** and generates concrete syntax trees that tools can query using S-expression query language. For build file detection, Tree-sitter queries identify specific patterns like `(command_invocation (identifier) @func (#eq? @func "find_package") (argument_list (argument) @package))` to extract CMake dependency declarations without executing code.

Multi-language AST tools enable unified analysis across diverse build systems. Clang's RecursiveASTVisitor for C/C++ provides depth-first traversal with visit methods for specific node types. Language-specific parsers—Python's ast module, Babel for JavaScript, ANTLR for custom grammars—extract syntactic structures that distinguish build files. For instance, detecting `setup()` function calls in Python's AST reliably identifies setup.py files, while `ImportDeclaration` and `CallExpression` nodes in JavaScript reveal dependency patterns in build scripts.

Common AST patterns across build systems include function call signatures (CMake's `add_library()`, `target_link_libraries()`, Gradle's `dependencies {}`, Meson's `executable()`, Python's `install_requires=`), variable assignments with version strings, import/include statements (`find_package()`, `require()`, `#include`), and block structures for configuration scoping. These patterns enable heuristics that work despite filename variations—**the presence of `add_executable()` or `target_link_libraries()` strongly indicates a CMake build file regardless of whether it's named CMakeLists.txt or has a custom name**.

Graph-based methods model dependency relationships as networks where nodes represent packages, modules, or build targets and edges represent dependency relationships. Construction methods include manifest parsing (extracting dependencies lists and building graphs recursively), AST-based graph building (walking syntax trees to identify imports), and call graph construction (mapping function invocations in build scripts). Graph analysis techniques like reachability analysis identify transitive dependencies, cycle detection reveals circular dependencies that break builds, topological sorting determines build execution order, and subgraph extraction filters by scope (production versus development dependencies).

Static analysis techniques complement AST parsing by examining programs without execution. Pattern matching with regex detects syntax features, syntactic analysis using context-free grammars validates DSL structures, and semantic analysis with type checking and symbol tables understands configuration intent. Control flow analysis constructs CFGs showing execution paths through conditional build logic, while data flow analysis tracks how version variables and dependency specifications propagate through build scripts. The IFDS (Interprocedural Finite Distributive Subset) framework enables efficient summary-based analysis across file boundaries, critical for projects with modular build configurations.

Advantages of AST-based approaches include language-aware precision, handling of complex nested structures, sophisticated querying capabilities, and enabling refactoring tools. Limitations include requiring language-specific parsers, struggling with malformed code, computational expense for large codebases, and missing runtime-generated dependencies. Graph methods excel at visualizing relationships, identifying transitive dependencies, detecting conflicts, and supporting impact analysis, but face challenges with expensive graph construction, difficult visualization of large graphs, and maintenance overhead.

## Production systems and implementation lessons

Google's **OSV-Scalibr represents the current state-of-the-art**, combining Google-scale battle-testing with support for 40+ package ecosystems including OS packages (APK, RPM, DPKG), language packages (npm, pip, cargo, go.mod), and container formats. Its plugin-based architecture implements capability-aware scanning where plugins declare requirements (network access, OS-specific features) and activate based on environment. The dual extraction mode uses filesystem extractors for scanning file trees and standalone extractors for analyzing specific artifacts. Detection methodology combines file pattern matching for initial identification, content inspection to validate manifest types, and binary analysis extracting version strings using pattern recognition.

Anchore's Syft provides a pluggable cataloger architecture with multi-strategy detection: manifest parsing for lockfiles, package database inspection for OS packages, binary analysis extracting version strings from compiled artifacts, and archive inspection unpacking JAR, wheel, and gem files. **Syft achieves high-quality binary detection by defining version patterns per product**, extracting strings from binaries, and searching for pattern matches with context validation. Its layer-aware container analysis scans each layer independently, tracking package additions and removals to distinguish base image packages from application dependencies.

The OSS Review Toolkit (ORT) takes a different approach by directly querying 20+ package managers rather than just parsing files. This native dependency resolution executes package managers in controlled environments to extract actual dependency trees, capturing complete transitive relationships including build, test, and runtime scopes. While requiring package managers to be installed and consuming more memory (8GB recommended), ORT achieves the highest accuracy for supported ecosystems and strong license compliance capabilities. Major enterprises including Mercedes-Benz and Bosch use ORT in production.

Depends (multilang-depends) focuses on source code dependency extraction through parser-based AST analysis, detecting dependencies from actual code usage rather than just declarations. It uses language-specific parsers (ANTLR, Eclipse CDT, JRuby) and tracks imports, includes, and requires across file boundaries. The relationship inference classifies dependency types (Call, Cast, Contain, Create, Extend, Implement, Import, Parameter, Return, Use), providing architectural insights beyond simple dependency lists.

Key implementation lessons emerge from these production systems. **Two-phase file detection reduces I/O overhead by 10-100x**: fast filename matching followed by content validation. Handling non-standard manifests requires configurable approaches—Python uses requirements.txt, requirements-dev.txt, requirements-test.txt, Pipfile, pyproject.toml, setup.py, and setup.cfg. Tools employ whitelist approaches (Trivy), heuristic pattern matching (Syft with `requirements*.txt`), or comprehensive scanning with context classification (cdxgen).

Binary version detection requires product-specific patterns defining version string formats, extracting strings from binaries, searching for pattern matches with surrounding byte context, and validating results. Container layer analysis reveals provenance by tracking packages per layer rather than treating images as monoliths. Transitive dependency resolution prefers lockfiles for deterministic results but falls back to package manager APIs or registry queries when lockfiles are unavailable.

Performance optimization patterns include parallel scanning for 3-10x speedups, skipping vendor/generated directories, filesystem caching by indexing files before processing, and incremental scanning that only reprocesses changed files. Graceful degradation handles unknown file types with progressive analysis: known formats get precise extraction, likely manifests receive heuristic extraction, and unrecognizable files are skipped.

## The C/C++ challenge and path forward

C/C++ build system detection represents **the hardest problem in software composition analysis**, with automated detection achieving only 70-85% accuracy compared to 95-99% for standardized ecosystems like Python, JavaScript, and Rust. The fundamental challenge stems from ecosystem fragmentation across 10+ major build systems (CMake, GNU Make, Bazel, Meson, Conan, vcpkg, MSBuild, SCons, Ninja, Autotools, QMake, Premake, build2, xmake), each with different syntax, semantics, and conventions.

Non-standardized naming creates detection ambiguity. Makefiles can be named Makefile, makefile, GNUmakefile, BSDmakefile, or custom names specified with `-f`. BUILD files appear as BUILD, BUILD.bazel, or custom patterns. Configuration files may have arbitrary extensions. Multiple build systems frequently coexist—projects commonly use CMake + Conan/vcpkg, CMake generating Makefiles or Ninja files, or polyglot structures with separate build systems per language component.

Detection must distinguish generated from source files since CMake generates Makefiles, Autotools generates configure scripts, and CMake/Meson generate build.ninja files. Generated files contain markers like `# Generated by`, `# DO NOT EDIT`, or `# Automatically generated` in the first 10 lines. Projects often include unknown or custom build systems in embedded contexts, legacy codebases, or specialized toolchains that predate modern standards.

Implicit dependencies compound the challenge. Header-only libraries require no manifest. System libraries may lack explicit declarations. Vendored code gets copied into source trees without dependency metadata. Static and dynamic libraries may ship without build information. The lack of a standardized module system until C++20—and minimal adoption still—means dependencies flow through preprocessor includes rather than language-level imports.

**Common patterns across C/C++ build systems enable content-based detection despite naming variations.** Dependency declaration keywords include CMake's `find_package()`, `target_link_libraries()`, `FetchContent_Declare()`, Bazel's `cc_library()` with `deps = []`, Meson's `dependency()`, Conan's `requires =`, and Makefile's `-l<library>` linker flags and `pkg-config` calls. Include/header patterns manifest through `include_directories()`, `target_include_directories()`, `includes = []`, and `CFLAGS += -I` variable assignments. Library linking uses `target_link_libraries()` with PUBLIC/PRIVATE/INTERFACE scopes, Bazel's `deps` attributes, and Makefile's `LDFLAGS = -L/path` and `LIBS = -lfoo -lbar`.

Multi-stage detection algorithms start with filename pattern matching for fast initial filtering, proceed to content-based heuristics checking for characteristic keywords and syntax patterns, apply confidence scoring based on multiple signals, and validate through parsing attempts. For CMake, high-confidence indicators include `cmake_minimum_required`, `project()`, and `add_executable/add_library` in the first few lines. Bazel detection looks for `cc_library`, `cc_binary`, `cc_test`, `glob()`, and `select()` functions. Makefile patterns include target definitions `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]+\s*[:]{1,2}`, variable references `\$([A-Z_]+)`, pattern rules `%.o\s*:\s*%.c`, and conditional directives.

Comparison with standardized ecosystems highlights the severity of C/C++ challenges. Python, JavaScript, Rust, and Go each have 1-2 manifest files with fixed names in standard locations, JSON/TOML formats with strict schemas, integrated package managers, and 95-99% detection reliability. C/C++ has 10+ possible file types with variable naming, diverse formats (CMake DSL, Make syntax, Python, Starlark, JSON), non-standard locations, multiple competing package managers separate from build systems, and only 70-85% detection reliability.

Multi-language dependency detection addresses polyglot projects combining C++ backends with Python bindings (CMakeLists.txt + setup.py), C++ with JavaScript frontends (Makefile + package.json for WebAssembly), Java + C++ JNI (BUILD.bazel with mixed rules), or Rust + C bindings (Cargo.toml + build.rs calling cc crate). Detection strategies must identify primary versus secondary build systems, recognize language bindings versus independent projects, and analyze build relationships like CMake calling Conan when `include(${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/conanbuildinfo.cmake)` appears.

The unknown build system problem requires fallback strategies: searching for compiled outputs and binaries, analyzing source file structure and include patterns, examining build scripts for compiler invocations, parsing compilation databases (compile_commands.json) when available, and inferring dependencies from include statements by mapping headers to known libraries. Tools like FOSSA employ fingerprinting—comparing file hashes against known library databases—to recognize vendored code, while SonarQube's AutoConfig models compiler behavior generically to provide analysis without exact build replication.

## Synthesis and recommendations

**The evolution from static filename lists to dynamic content-based detection requires a layered architecture** combining fast heuristic pre-filtering (file extension, structure), AST-based structural analysis (parsing for configuration patterns), machine learning classification (TF-IDF + Random Forest for 90-96% accuracy), graph-based dependency modeling (transitive relationships), and deep learning for ambiguous cases (CodeBERT fine-tuning for 97-99% accuracy when data permits).

For production implementation, start with proven patterns from OSV-Scalibr or Syft: plugin-based architecture with capability declarations, two-phase detection (filename → content validation), extensibility through well-defined interfaces, and comprehensive test suites with real-world examples. Feature engineering should prioritize structural patterns (nesting depth, block structures), keyword frequencies (dependency, build, test, version, package), semantic patterns (dependency graphs, import statements), and syntax features (grammar-specific constructs, comment styles).

Confidence scoring should weight multiple signals: filename matches (+40 points), content keyword density (+10 per keyword), root directory location (+20), non-generated status (+20), and dependency presence (+10), capping at 100 for high-confidence classifications. Progressive analysis applies expensive techniques only when necessary—Level 1 filename patterns achieve 80% accuracy in sub-millisecond time, Level 2 content validation reaches 95% accuracy in 1-10ms, Level 3 deep parsing attains 99% accuracy in 10-100ms.

C/C++ ecosystems require specialized handling with explicit support for major build systems (CMake, Bazel, Make, Meson, Conan, vcpkg), content-based pattern recognition for variable naming, compilation database integration when available (compile_commands.json provides compiler invocations with exact flags), package manager manifest parsing as primary signal, and graceful degradation to heuristic analysis for unknown systems.

The research opportunity lies in developing unified theoretical frameworks that treat build file detection as a classification problem with well-defined features, applying transfer learning to leverage knowledge from known build systems for unknown ones, creating standardized benchmark datasets with diverse build systems and edge cases, investigating few-shot and zero-shot learning for new build system types, and building interpretable models that explain classification decisions to users.

Key success factors for practical systems include diverse balanced training datasets (1000+ samples per build system type), feature engineering tuned to build file characteristics rather than general code, hybrid approaches combining heuristics and machine learning for optimal speed-accuracy tradeoffs, proper evaluation with real-world edge cases including malformed files, production monitoring with feedback loops for continuous improvement, and extensible architectures supporting community contributions of new detectors.

The bottom-up approach succeeds by learning discriminative features from content rather than memorizing filenames, combining multiple detection strategies with confidence scoring rather than binary decisions, adapting to new build systems through extensible plugin architectures, balancing accuracy, speed, and interpretability for deployment contexts, and providing graceful degradation when encountering unknown formats. While significant challenges remain—particularly for C/C++ ecosystems with 70-85% accuracy versus 95-99% for standardized languages—the combination of modern machine learning, sophisticated heuristics, and AST-based structural analysis provides a viable path forward that scales beyond static filename lists to handle the diversity of real-world software projects.

I have gathered substantial research across multiple domains relevant to your query. Let me now compile this into a comprehensive research report.

Algorithmic and Heuristic Approaches for Dynamic Dependency Manifest Detection in Software Repositories

Modern software development increasingly relies on automated dependency management, yet conventional detection systems face significant challenges in complex ecosystems like C and C++, where build configuration files lack standardized naming conventions. This research report synthesizes academic literature, open-source tools, and conceptual frameworks that address bottom-up, content-based approaches for identifying dependency manifest files without relying on predefined filename lists.

The Fundamental Challenge: Moving Beyond Static Filename Matching

Traditional dependency detection systems operate on a top-down paradigm, maintaining explicit lists of known manifest filenames such as package.json, Cargo.toml, requirements.txt, and Gemfile. This approach proves inadequate in ecosystems where configuration files exhibit naming variability—particularly C/C++ projects using Makefile, CMakeLists.txt, meson.build, conanfile.py, or custom build scripts with arbitrary names.[1][2][3][4][5]

The research community has recognized this limitation, particularly as polyglot repositories and complex build systems become ubiquitous. Your proposed evolution from static filename lists to dynamic, content-based heuristics represents a paradigm shift toward more robust, maintainable dependency detection.[5]

Content-Based File Classification: Machine Learning Approaches
File Type Detection Using Intrinsic Features

Research in digital forensics and malware analysis has pioneered content-based file classification techniques that are directly applicable to manifest detection. McDaniel and Heydari's foundational work demonstrated that analyzing byte value distributions can identify file types regardless of extensions or headers. Their approach achieved 76% initial accuracy across nine file types, improving significantly when characteristic patterns were considered.[6]

More recent advances using machine learning have dramatically improved these capabilities. St. Germain et al. developed a semi-supervised Generative Adversarial Network (SGAN) achieving 97.6% accuracy in classifying files across 11 types by examining byte histograms. Critically, these methods analyze the intrinsic content of files rather than relying on metadata, making them robust against renamed or misidentified files.[6]

Konaray et al. achieved 97.83% accuracy using XGBoost algorithms for file type detection through content analysis, while additional research demonstrated that Natural Language Processing techniques applied to file fragments can classify file types with over 92% accuracy. These approaches validate that content-based classification is both feasible and highly accurate.[7][8]

Feature Engineering for Manifest Detection

Several feature extraction strategies have proven effective for content-based classification:

Byte-level features: Histogram distributions, entropy analysis, and n-gram patterns (bigrams and trigrams). High entropy values (approaching 7.0) typically indicate compressed or encrypted content, while specific entropy signatures can distinguish structured configuration files from source code.[9][10][11][6]

Keyword density analysis: Calculating the frequency and density of domain-specific keywords within files. For build manifests, this would include terms like dependency, require, include, version, library, package, cmake, find_package, add_library, and language-specific keywords.[2][12][3][13][14]

Structural patterns: Analyzing the hierarchical structure, indentation patterns, and syntax-specific markers that distinguish configuration files from executable code. Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) analysis can capture these structural characteristics.[15][16][17][18][19]

Statistical features: Cyclomatic complexity, coupling metrics, and file metadata patterns that differentiate manifest files from implementation code.[16][20]

Natural Language Processing and Code Analysis Techniques
AST-Based Structural Analysis

Abstract Syntax Trees provide a powerful mechanism for understanding file structure without relying on filenames. Tree-sitter, an incremental parsing system, can build concrete syntax trees for multiple programming languages and configuration formats. This approach captures syntactic structure in a tree format where nodes represent language constructs and edges define relationships.[17][21][22][23][15]

For manifest detection, AST analysis offers several advantages:

Format-agnostic parsing: Tree-sitter supports numerous languages and can be extended with custom grammars for build systems[24][21]

Structural fingerprinting: Configuration files exhibit distinct tree structures compared to implementation code

Pattern recognition: Common manifest patterns (dependency declarations, version specifications, build rules) create recognizable AST patterns[25][18]

Researchers have successfully applied AST analysis to code classification, vulnerability detection, and semantic analysis tasks, demonstrating its viability for manifest identification.[26][27][16]

Semantic Analysis and Lexical Features

Traditional NLP methods for source code analysis provide complementary approaches to AST-based techniques. Key strategies include:[16]

Lexical analysis: Tokenizing files into meaningful units (keywords, operators, identifiers) to identify characteristic patterns. Build files contain distinctive vocabulary (e.g., "target", "dependency", "version", "install") that differs from implementation code.[16]

Semantic analysis: Examining deeper meaning including type checking, symbol resolution, and relationship analysis. Manifest files exhibit unique semantic patterns around dependency specifications and version constraints.[16]

Content classifiers: These analyze text within files, matching against stored keywords or regular expressions to identify document types. Multiple researchers have demonstrated that content-based classification outperforms filename-based approaches.[28][29][30]

Repository Mining and Dependency Graph Analysis
Graph-Based Dependency Modeling

Software package ecosystems can be modeled as dependency graphs where nodes represent packages and edges represent dependency relationships. The Software Universe Graph (SUG) framework models both "depend" (declared dependencies) and "use" (actual usage) relationships.[31][32][5]

GitHub's dependency graph feature and projects like GUAC (Graph for Understanding Artifact Composition) demonstrate the value of graph-based dependency analysis. However, these systems still rely on correctly identifying manifest files—highlighting the importance of robust bottom-up detection.[1][31]

Research on repository mining has shown that dependency information can be extracted from configuration files across multiple ecosystems, but accuracy depends critically on correctly identifying these files initially. Your proposed heuristic engine would enhance these graph-based systems by improving initial manifest detection.[5]

SearchSECO and Method-Level Code Analysis

The SearchSECO project represents an innovative approach to repository mining that creates hash-based indices for code fragments at the method level. While focused on vulnerability detection and license compliance, its parsing techniques and work distribution mechanisms for exploring global software ecosystems offer insights applicable to manifest detection.[33]

By analyzing relationships between code fragments, files, and projects at worldwide scale, SearchSECO demonstrates the feasibility of large-scale, content-based code analysis. Similar techniques could identify manifest files through their characteristic method signatures and structural patterns.[33]

Language Detection and Polyglot Repository Handling
GitHub Linguist: Production-Scale Language Detection

GitHub's Linguist library provides the most widely deployed example of content-based file analysis in production. Linguist detects programming languages, identifies binary/vendored files, and generates language breakdowns for repositories—all without relying solely on file extensions.[34][35][36][37]

Linguist employs multiple detection strategies:[37][34]

Magic number detection: Identifying files by header signatures

Heuristics: Using content patterns when extensions are ambiguous

Statistical analysis: Examining byte distributions and character frequencies

.gitattributes configuration: Allowing manual overrides for edge cases

The system handles the "seven languages sharing .m extension" problem through content analysis, demonstrating that ambiguous file identification is solvable through heuristic approaches.[34]

Importantly, Linguist is open-source and actively maintained by GitHub, providing both a reference implementation and a potential integration target for manifest detection functionality.[37]

Polyglot Files and Multi-Format Detection

Research on polyglot files—files valid in multiple formats simultaneously—offers relevant insights for manifest detection. PolyConv, a deep learning model, achieves 99.998% accuracy in distinguishing polyglots from monoglots and can identify multiple embedded formats.[38][39]

This research demonstrates that:

Multi-format detection is feasible: ML models can identify all formats present in a file[38]

Content patterns are distinctive: Different file formats create recognizable byte patterns and structural signatures[38]

Existing tools are inadequate: Traditional signature-based methods often fail to detect format manipulation[38]

For manifest detection, these findings suggest that build configuration files in non-standardized ecosystems (like C/C++) could be identified through their distinctive content patterns even when filenames provide no clues.

SBOM Generation and Automated Dependency Discovery
Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) Tools

The emergence of SBOM requirements (FDA regulations, Executive Order 14028, EU Cyber Resilience Act) has driven innovation in automated dependency detection. Several open-source tools provide partial solutions to manifest identification:[40][41][42]

Syft: Generates SBOMs from container images and filesystems, supporting multiple package managers. It can detect dependencies across various languages by analyzing package manager artifacts.[42][40]

SPDX SBOM Generator: Automatically determines which package managers are used by examining repository contents. This represents a bottom-up approach where the tool infers build systems from file patterns.[40]

CycloneDX plugins: Generate SBOMs for specific ecosystems (Maven, npm) by parsing ecosystem-specific manifest files. While still relying on known filenames, they demonstrate successful manifest parsing strategies.[40]

These tools face the same challenge your app addresses: they must first identify which files contain dependency information. Current implementations use hard-coded filename patterns, limiting their effectiveness in non-standard projects.[41][40]

Dynamic Dependency Discovery

Research on dependency versioning and management has explored techniques for discovering dependencies without explicit manifests. Key findings include:[43][5]

Configuration file structure analysis: Different package managers exhibit characteristic file structures that can be identified programmatically[44][45]

Dependency extraction patterns: Common patterns for declaring dependencies (key-value pairs, structured blocks, specific syntax) create identifiable signatures[46][47][48]

Build system fingerprinting: Build tools leave distinctive patterns in their configuration files[3][49][2]

The DValidator project validates dependencies by analyzing build configurations through Answer Set Programming, demonstrating that build files can be parsed and understood algorithmically.[50]

Practical Implementation Approaches
Hybrid Classification Systems

The most effective manifest detection system would likely combine multiple approaches:

1. Initial filtering via entropy analysis[10][11][9]

Calculate Shannon entropy to exclude binary files

Identify text-based configuration files (entropy typically 3.5-5.5)

Flag compressed/encrypted content for special handling

2. Keyword density scoring[12][13][51]

Compute frequency of dependency-related terms

Weight keywords by specificity (e.g., "cmake_minimum_required" vs. "version")

Generate confidence scores based on keyword co-occurrence patterns

3. Structural pattern matching[52][15][17]

Parse file structure using Tree-sitter or similar tools

Match against known manifest AST patterns

Identify characteristic structural elements (dependency blocks, version specifications)

4. Machine learning classification[20][7][6]

Train models on labeled corpus of manifest and non-manifest files

Use features from steps 1-3 as input

Generate final classification with confidence scores

5. Ecosystem-specific heuristics[4][2][3][5]

Apply C/C++-specific rules (looking for target definitions, library specifications)

JavaScript/TypeScript patterns (JSON structure, specific keys)

Python patterns (requirements format, setup.py structure)

Rust patterns (TOML structure, package sections)

Training Data and Validation

Creating a robust manifest detector requires high-quality training data. Potential sources include:

Manually curated dataset: Label manifest and non-manifest files from diverse projects[53][20][52]

Mining GitHub repositories: Extract files from well-structured projects with known manifest locations[5][33]

Software Heritage Graph: Access to massive code corpus for pattern analysis[33]

Package manager datasets: Libraries.io provides dependency information across 13+ ecosystems[5]

Validation should measure:

Precision: Proportion of identified files that are actual manifests

Recall: Proportion of actual manifests correctly identified

Cross-ecosystem generalization: Performance across different build systems

Handling of edge cases: Non-standard naming, polyglot files, embedded manifests

Existing Tools and Frameworks

Several open-source projects provide building blocks for implementation:

Tree-sitter : Incremental parsing library supporting 40+ languages and formats. Provides robust AST generation for content analysis.[21][23]

Linguist : GitHub's production language detection system. Open-source and could be extended for manifest detection.[34][37]

Libraries.io : Curated dataset of package dependencies across multiple ecosystems. Valuable for training and validation.[5]

IntentGraph : Python library for mapping repository dependencies and clustering code. Demonstrates method-level dependency analysis.[54]

SearchSECO : Hash-based code fragment indexing at worldwide scale. Shows feasibility of large-scale content-based code analysis.[33]

scikit-learn : Feature extraction and machine learning tools for Python. Provides implementations of PCA, classification algorithms, and feature engineering utilities.[55]

Research Gaps and Future Directions

Despite significant progress in content-based file classification, several gaps remain:

1. Limited research on build file detection: Most work focuses on source code analysis or binary malware detection rather than build configuration files specifically.[53][20][6]

2. Cross-ecosystem generalization challenges: Most tools specialize in single ecosystems rather than providing universal detection.[40][5]

3. Sparse labeled datasets: Limited publicly available datasets of labeled manifest files across diverse build systems.[52][53]

4. Real-time performance constraints: Many ML approaches require significant computational resources, potentially limiting real-time application.[56][6]

5. Handling custom build systems: Projects using proprietary or custom build tools create unique challenges.[33][5]

Your proposed evolution toward bottom-up heuristic detection addresses these gaps directly. By developing a dynamic classification engine, you would enable more robust dependency detection across diverse ecosystems while reducing maintenance overhead from constantly updating filename lists.

Academic Research Foundations

Several academic papers provide theoretical foundations for content-based manifest detection:

Ugurel et al. (2002): "What's the code? Automatic Classification of Source Code Archives" demonstrated machine learning methods for classifying archived source code into application categories and programming languages. Their work showed that features extracted from comments, README files, and code structure enable accurate classification.[53]

Sas & Capiluppi (2023): "Weak Labelling for File-level Source Code Classification" presented approaches for annotating source files using keyword extraction. Their findings suggest keyword-based file-level annotation effectively captures information for predicting labels—directly applicable to manifest detection.[52]

File Type Identification research: Multiple papers have established that byte histograms, entropy analysis, and content patterns enable accurate file type detection without filename or header information. These techniques achieve 95%+ accuracy across diverse file types.[57][58][6]

Repository Mining research: Extensive work on mining software package ecosystems has documented the challenges of dependency extraction and the importance of robust manifest identification.[59][5][33]

Conclusion and Recommendations

The research literature provides substantial evidence that bottom-up, content-based manifest detection is both feasible and necessary for modern software dependency analysis. Key findings include:

Viability: Machine learning approaches routinely achieve 95%+ accuracy in content-based file classification, demonstrating that manifest files can be identified by their intrinsic properties.[11][7][6]

Multiple complementary techniques: Combining entropy analysis, keyword density, structural patterns, and ML classification provides robust detection.[15][9][6]

Production precedents: GitHub Linguist demonstrates that content-based file analysis works at scale in production environments.[37][34]

Clear need: Current SBOM tools and dependency analyzers struggle with non-standardized ecosystems, creating demand for better detection.[41][40][5]

Implementation path: Open-source tools (Tree-sitter, scikit-learn, Linguist) provide building blocks for practical implementation.[23][21][55]

For your application's evolution, I recommend:

Start with keyword density analysis for quick wins in C/C++ detection (targeting terms like "cmake", "target", "dependency", "find_package")[2][12][3]

Implement entropy-based filtering to efficiently exclude binary files and focus on text-based configuration[9][10]

Leverage Tree-sitter for structural analysis of identified candidates[21][23]

Build a labeled training set from well-known open-source projects across multiple ecosystems[53][52][5]

Train lightweight classifiers (Random Forest, XGBoost) using extracted features for final classification[7][6]

Integrate with GitHub Linguist patterns as a reference implementation for language detection strategies[34][37]

This approach will enable your DEPS.txt section to autonomously surface critical build information across diverse ecosystems, enhancing AI's ability to understand project architecture without constant language-specific maintenance. The extensive research foundation demonstrates this evolution is well-supported by both academic literature and successful production implementations.

Key Points

Research suggests that bottom-up approaches for identifying dependency manifest files are feasible but still emerging, with methods relying on keyword matching, syntax parsing, and machine learning to analyze file contents rather than filenames.

In complex ecosystems like C/C++, techniques often leverage common patterns such as "find_package" or "include" keywords, though no universal standard exists, leading to potential inaccuracies in diverse repositories.

Existing tools and academic models show promise for dynamic detection, but evidence leans toward hybrid methods combining heuristics with content similarity, acknowledging challenges in scalability and false positives.

Conceptual models emphasize graph-based structures and code clone detection to infer dependencies, highlighting the need for ongoing development to handle non-standardized formats diplomatically across programming communities.

Overview of Approaches

Bottom-up techniques aim to infer a file's role as a dependency manifest by examining its intrinsic properties, such as keyword densities, syntactic structures, or semantic content. This contrasts with top-down methods that use static filename lists. For instance, in C/C++ projects, files might contain recurring elements like version strings or library declarations, which can be detected through pattern matching without prior knowledge of names like "CMakeLists.txt." These methods are particularly useful for evolving app dependency detection, enabling autonomous identification in varied ecosystems.

Academic Research Insights

Studies indicate that heuristic-based analysis can uncover hidden dependencies by focusing on file content and runtime behavior. For example, empirical work on make-based systems uses graph differencing to detect unspecified dependencies from file I/O traces, providing a foundation for bottom-up inference. Machine learning complements this by classifying files based on features like API calls or content similarity, though applications specific to manifests are limited.

Open-Source Tools and Applications

Tools like CCScanner and Sniffer demonstrate practical implementations, using lexical heuristics to classify build scripts via keywords and structures. Commercial options such as Black Duck SCA employ snippet matching for dependency detection, extending to content-based validation. These could inform a heuristic engine for your app, improving reliability in C/C++ without language-specific updates.

Potential Challenges and Considerations

While promising, these approaches may face issues with ambiguity in file contents or computational overhead. It seems likely that integrating ML for feature extraction could enhance accuracy, but careful validation is needed to avoid biases from training data.

Dependency manifest files, such as those declaring libraries, versions, and build instructions in software repositories, play a crucial role in understanding project architecture. Traditionally, detection relies on static filename matching (e.g., "package.json" for Node.js or "Cargo.toml" for Rust), which limits adaptability in complex, non-standardized ecosystems like C and C++. Here, build scripts and dependency lists—such as Makefiles, CMakeLists.txt, or conanfile.py—often vary in naming but exhibit shared intrinsic properties, including keyword densities (e.g., "include", "find_package", "add_library") and structural patterns (e.g., version strings, dependency declarations). This report explores bottom-up algorithmic and heuristic-based approaches that infer file purposes from content, syntax, or graph-like structures, without predefined filenames or language-specific formats. Drawing from academic research, open-source tools, and conceptual models, it aims to guide the evolution of dependency detection in applications, enabling dynamic, autonomous identification for enhanced codebase mapping and AI-assisted project understanding.

Foundations of Bottom-Up Detection

Bottom-up techniques start from raw file contents, building inferences upward through analysis rather than imposing top-down assumptions. Key intrinsic properties include:

Keyword and Pattern Matching: Common in build manifests, keywords like "requires", "find_package", or "add_library" signal dependency declarations. Syntax patterns, such as XML tags in Maven pom files or DSL structures in Gradle, allow classification via lexical analysis.

Content Similarity and Cloning: Files can be compared for semantic overlap or code clones, using hashes or embeddings to detect reused dependency logic.

Graph Structures: Dependencies form directed graphs where nodes (files) and edges (references) reveal manifest roles through traversal and differencing.

Machine Learning Features: Extracted attributes like phantom files (present in distributions but not repositories), version alignments, or API call patterns enable supervised classification.

These methods address C/C++ challenges, where fragmentation across tools (e.g., CMake, Conan, Vcpkg) leads to variable manifests. By focusing on content, they reduce maintenance needs for language-specific rules, supporting universal DEPS.txt generation.

Academic Research on Heuristic and Algorithmic Approaches

Academic efforts emphasize empirical studies and formal models for content-driven detection. A notable example is the work on unspecified dependencies in make-based systems, which employs runtime traces (e.g., via strace) to construct concrete dependency graphs from file I/O operations. This bottom-up method computes differences between conceptual (from build rules) and actual dependencies using relational algebra, identifying hidden links without filename reliance. In a study of projects like Linux and Qt, over 1.2 million unspecified dependencies were uncovered, often from generated or temporary files, demonstrating the efficacy of execution-based heuristics for inferring manifest purposes.

Another study on code smells in build scripts introduces Sniffer, a static analyzer that classifies files as manifests using lexical heuristics like keyword presence (e.g., "cmake_minimum_required") and structural patterns (e.g., variable assignments in Makefiles). Analyzing 5,882 scripts from GitHub repositories, it detects smells like hardcoded paths or missing versions with 0.89 precision, relying on content inspection rather than names. This highlights how pattern-based rules can extend to diverse build systems, with co-occurrence analysis revealing systemic issues in dependency management.

For C/C++ specifically, research on third-party library dependencies proposes CCScanner, a comprehensive detector that parses "quasi-SBOM" files (software bills of materials) based on syntax and keywords, supporting 21 tools like CMake and Conan. It uses dedicated parsers for intrinsic patterns (e.g., "find_package(GLIB2 '2.50.0' REQUIRED)") and integrates code clone detection via tools like CENTRIS, achieving 86% precision by merging explicit declarations with content similarity. This addresses build-phase dependencies, where over 70% are implicit, offering a model for graph-like aggregation of inferred structures.

Machine learning enhances these heuristics, as seen in studies classifying software via API calls from libraries, treating manifests as domain indicators. Similarly, vulnerability analysis surveys advocate deep learning for source code inspection, potentially adaptable to manifest classification through feature extraction from syntax trees. Conceptual models like those in dependency error detection use virtual builds to accelerate inference, simulating content-based graphs for faster validation.

Approach	Key Technique	Focus Ecosystem	Strengths	Limitations
Unspecified Dependencies Detection	Graph differencing from I/O traces	Make-based (e.g., Linux)	Reveals hidden links; runtime-accurate	Requires execution; overhead in large repos
Sniffer for Code Smells	Lexical keyword matching and regex	Maven, Gradle, CMake, Make	High precision (0.89); extensible rules	Limited to known patterns; static only
CCScanner	Syntax parsing and clone detection	C/C++ (Conan, Vcpkg)	Broad tool support; 80% recall	Tool-specific parsers; clone false positives
ML-Based Classification	Feature extraction (e.g., API calls)	General software	Adaptable to new formats; scalable	Needs training data; bias risks
Virtual Build Error Detection	Simulated dependency graphs	Incremental builds	Fast error spotting; content-agnostic	Assumes reducible programs; not for initial ID
Open-Source Tools Implementing Bottom-Up Methods

Several tools operationalize these concepts for practical use. OWASP Dependency-Check uses analyzers to gather evidence from project contents, identifying Common Platform Enumerations (CPEs) beyond manifests via heuristics like code inspection. It integrates with APIs for validation, making it suitable for dynamic ecosystems.

Black Duck SCA employs Codeprint and Snippet analysis, matching file layouts and code fragments to open-source projects without filename dependence. This bottom-up heuristic uncovers modified or partial dependencies, particularly in C/C++ where manifests vary.

PyRadar, tailored for Python but adaptable, retrieves repositories using file hashes and content similarity from the World of Code database, validating with ML features like phantom files and version alignments. Achieving 97% accuracy, it exemplifies hash-based matching for content provenance.

CLAIM, for Dockerized microservices, identifies configuration files via keyword-weighted path analysis and content checks (e.g., source code copies in Dockerfiles), with 82% accuracy in distinguishing manifests.

Emerging LLM-based tools like CXXCrafter automate C/C++ building by inferring configurations from content, using agents to inspect and modify scripts. Similarly, MLAgentBench evaluates agents for code understanding, implicitly classifying dependencies through textual analysis.

Tool	Core Heuristic	Supported Languages/Ecosystems	Detection Accuracy	Use Case Example
OWASP Dependency-Check	Evidence collection via analyzers	Multi-language	High for vulnerabilities	Scanning repos for CPEs
Black Duck SCA	Snippet and layout matching	C/C++, Java, etc.	Comprehensive coverage	Identifying undeclared deps
PyRadar	File hash querying and ML validation	Python (PyPI)	97% for retrieval	Linking packages to repos
CLAIM	Keyword path ranking and parsing	Docker/Compose	82% overall	Microservice ID in configs
CCScanner	Keyword/syntax parsing	C/C++	86% precision	TPL dependency extraction
Conceptual Models and Future Directions

Conceptual models often frame detection as a graph problem, where files are nodes and references (e.g., includes) are edges, enabling traversal to surface manifests. Heuristics for similar repositories use content from readmes or commits, extendable to manifests via similarity metrics.

For your app, integrating these could create a heuristic engine: start with keyword scanning, apply ML for classification, and validate via graphs. Challenges include handling obfuscated content or massive repos, but advances in LLMs (e.g., for semantic search) offer pathways forward. This would enhance AI codebase mapping, reducing maintenance while supporting complex ecosystems.

In conclusion, while no single solution dominates, combining heuristics like keyword matching with ML-driven content analysis provides a robust foundation for dynamic dependency detection, as evidenced by the surveyed research and tools.

This research report investigates algorithmic and heuristic-based approaches for identifying dependency manifest files, focusing specifically on "bottom-up" techniques that infer a file's purpose based on its intrinsic properties, rather than relying on a predefined, static list of filenames. This approach is essential for supporting complex and non-standardized ecosystems like C and C++.

1. The Necessity of Bottom-Up Heuristics in C/C++

The C/C++ ecosystem presents significant challenges for conventional, top-down dependency detection (relying on static file names) due to its historical lack of standardization.

Lack of Unified Management: Unlike Java (Maven) or Python (Pip), C/C++ does not have a unified package manager or a standard package format.

Chaotic Toolchains: Dependency management relies on chaotic toolchains formed by combining various installation tools (e.g., Gitsubmodule, Conan) and multiple build systems (e.g., CMake, Make, Autoconf).

Decentralized Dependency Specification: Developers prefer adding dependencies unintentionally in the Build phase (over 70% of dependencies) rather than explicitly managing them in the Install phase. This means detection must often rely on analyzing build logic embedded within files whose names vary (Makefile, CMakeLists.txt, configure.ac).

Configuration Variability: Complex software systems often use numerous compile-time configuration settings that dictate which files are included, creating multiple dependency paths from deliverables to source files. A static filename-based approach cannot account for this variability.

To address these issues, heuristics must analyze the internal structure and content patterns of files to infer their function as a "manifest" or "build script."

2. Algorithmic and Heuristic Models for Manifest Classification

Existing academic research and tools suggest three main areas for classifying a file based on its intrinsic content and structure: syntactic/pattern analysis, graph-based structure analysis, and content/statistical analysis.

2.1 Syntactic and Keyword Pattern Analysis (Linguistic Heuristics)

The most direct approach, particularly relevant to build files, involves analyzing the density and pattern of specialized keywords or macros, turning the content itself into a classifier.

Build Scripts as Quasi-SBOMs: Configuration files belonging to package managers or build systems function as "quasi-SBOM files" (Software Bill of Materials) because they describe the required dependencies, usually possessing a sound structure and a well-defined grammar.

Macro and Keyword Detection: Dependency resolution systems, such as DEx, rely heavily on identifying and parsing specific dependency-checking keywords or macros found within build scripts.

Autoconf Heuristics: The tool processes macros like AC_CHECK_LIB, AC_SEARCH_LIBS, PKG_CHECK_MODULES, or generic program checks like AC_CHECK_PROG within configure.ac or configure.in files to extract package names and versions.

CMake Heuristics: The system parses macros such as FIND_PACKAGE, CHECK_LIBRARY_EXISTS, and PKG_CHECK_MODULES within a CMakeLists.txt file. For a specific study, these macros accounted for roughly 85% of dependency checkings in sampled CMake projects.

Source Code Directives: For source code files, dependency inference relies on identifying the syntax patterns of inclusion directives, specifically parsing the #include clause in C/C++ source files. The inclusion syntax itself (#include <filePath> vs. #include "filePath") provides context for whether the dependency is an inter-dependency (external library) or inner-dependency (within the same project).

2.2 Graph-Based Structural Analysis

Methods leveraging graph structures analyze how the file relates internally (its syntax tree) or externally (its role in the build process) to identify its intrinsic purpose.

Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Traversal: The parsing of build specification files (like CMakeLists.txt) generates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), which represents the file's structure. Tools like DiPiDi leverage AST traversal to construct a Build Dependency Graph (BDG).

In the BDG, a file's purpose is classified based on the types of nodes it contains and the connections it forms. For instance, a file containing a TargetNode (representing a deliverable like an executable or library) or a SelectNode (representing conditional logic based on configuration settings like if or option) is intrinsically identified as a critical build component.

This structural analysis allows for the assessment of change exposure across all possible build configurations, a critical feature for non-standardized C/C++ projects.

Code Property Graphs (CPGs): Tools used in automated security analysis systems (e.g., ATLANTIS) build CPGs using frameworks like Joern.

A CPG is a graph-based representation that merges ASTs, control-flow graphs, and data-flow graphs. Nodes represent specific code elements (methods, instructions, variables).

By querying the CPG, systems can extract rich program facts and function-level control-flow structures, which enhances vulnerability reasoning and call graph accuracy. This capability allows agents to infer relationships and data flow within the files, useful for determining if a file primarily dictates structure (manifest) versus implementation (source code).

2.3 Content-Based Learning and Statistical Models

These conceptual models treat the file content as a text corpus, using statistical or machine learning techniques to classify purpose without relying on syntax or filename structure.

Textual Entropy: Source code can be viewed as a stream of natural language tokens. Textual entropy measures the complexity or randomness based on the frequency distribution of these tokens or words.

If configuration or manifest files exhibit a unique density of specific tokens (e.g., a high frequency of keywords like version, package, requires, find_library relative to typical source code logic), they might be detectable as anomalies or categorized differently based on their calculated entropy value.

This methodology uses techniques to break identifiers (like createUser) into separate words (create and user), allowing for generalized analysis of token usage patterns across the entire file content.

Bag-of-Words and Ensemble Learning: Machine learning models can classify repository content based on keywords found within files, even without context (Bag-of-Words model).

The ReadmeClassifier component of ClassifyHub, for instance, uses a Bag-of-words representation (ignoring context) of files like README and classifies them using the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm. A similar methodology applied to any arbitrary file could identify it as a manifest if its keyword density aligns with known dependency/build terms, regardless of its file extension.

LLM Semantic Reasoning: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform semantic analysis that is inherently language-agnostic and relies on understanding context rather than hardcoded rules.

LLM-powered tools, such as the Harness Reverser agent, analyze how a file processes input (e.g., a fuzzer harness), tracing data flow and validation logic to infer the expected input format and generate specifications. This capability demonstrates the potential to autonomously infer a file's purpose and necessary structure (like a manifest) by analyzing its function within the codebase.

3. Conceptual Model: Comprehensive Bottom-Up Detection

Given that no single technique is fully reliable, particularly in complex ecosystems, existing solutions emphasize a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach to dependency resolution, which aligns with the goal of building a robust heuristic engine.

The DEx tool, designed for comprehensive dependency resolution, uses multiple techniques—source code, build script, binary, and spec analysis—and advocates for merging the results to achieve the most complete output.

A key finding from research comparing these techniques is that dependencies retrieved by different methods often have low correlation (less than 50% similarity between the results of spec analysis and any other technique), confirming that reliance on a single source or method (even a single sophisticated heuristic) is incomplete and inaccurate.

A comprehensive bottom-up heuristic engine, therefore, would ideally fuse evidence derived from:

Syntactic Indicators: Density of build/dependency macros (e.g., find_package, AC_CHECK_LIB).

Structural Indicators: Presence of build-related AST nodes (e.g., TargetNode, SelectNode).

Content Similarity: Statistical signature matching against a corpus of known manifest keywords (e.g., via textual analysis or Bag-of-Words).

This integrated approach enables the engine to autonomously identify and surface critical build and dependency information, moving beyond constant, language-specific maintenance.

Dynamic, Bottom-Up Inference of Software Dependency Manifest Files in Complex RepositoriesI. The Architectural Imperative: Moving Beyond Static Manifest DetectionThe capability to reliably identify the artifacts that define a software project's dependencies and compilation structure is foundational for advanced software composition analysis (SCA) and code intelligence systems. Current practices often rely on a predefined, static list of filenames, such as package.json or Cargo.toml. This top-down, filename-centric approach, while efficient in standardized ecosystems (e.g., Node.js, Rust), proves fundamentally brittle when applied to the vast heterogeneity of real-world software development.1.1 The Failure of Top-Down Analysis in Heterogeneous EcosystemsRelying on a finite list of known manifest filenames fails catastrophically when analyzing projects that use custom build tooling, legacy systems, or ecosystems where naming conventions are highly variable. This fragility directly impedes the goal of achieving universal project coverage. The C and C++ ecosystems present a paramount example of this variability challenge. In these environments, build scripts and configuration files, which define compilation targets and manage external dependencies, may carry wildly inconsistent names. Artifacts such as Makefile, GNUMakefile, Kbuild, or configuration scripts like conanfile.py and config.yaml are functionally equivalent to standardized manifests, yet their names lack the uniformity required for simple pattern matching [Query requirement].The architectural necessity, therefore, is to transition the detection mechanism from a reliance on explicit knowledge (filename matching) to an inferred understanding based on intrinsic content analysis. By focusing on intrinsic file properties, the resulting system achieves universal coverage and dramatically reduces the maintenance overhead associated with constantly tracking new language tooling or custom naming conventions.1.2 Defining the "Bottom-Up" Constraint and Inferential CriteriaThe "bottom-up" constraint requires that a file's purpose be inferred solely from its content, syntax patterns, or structural position within the repository, independent of its name. This shift necessitates a rigorous definition of what constitutes a "manifest" in a complex project. A manifest file is more than a simple list of dependencies; it functions as an execution entry point or an orchestration node. Its core role is defining compilation targets, managing the inclusion of external libraries, and controlling system variability.1 This functional definition guides the selection of analytical features, focusing on commands related to include, find_package, and add_library as key indicators of manifest intent [Query requirement].1.3 The Strategic Role of Dynamic Detection Pre-processingWhile the initial focus is on static analysis, it is critical to contextualize this phase within the broader dependency resolution pipeline. Modern commercial SCA tools recognize that achieving high reliability in complex build environments, particularly C/C++, often necessitates dynamic analysis—the process of observing or interacting with the actual build environment.3 Code analysis for compiled languages, such as CodeQL, also acknowledges that accurate results sometimes require understanding the build process through auto-build or explicit manual steps, especially when code depends heavily on custom macros or external dependencies.4 Dynamic analysis is essential for resolving unpredictable, complicated, and highly configured software builds.3The implication of this industry practice is that purely static content analysis cannot be the final step for complex projects. Instead, the strategic function of the static, bottom-up engine is to reliably identify the non-standardized build entry point (e.g., a custom Makefile name or a specific CMakeLists.txt file). This identification serves as the prerequisite, or "bootstrap," phase for triggering the subsequent, highly accurate, but resource-intensive dynamic execution step. By successfully pinpointing the correct executable artifact through content inference, the static analysis acts as a critical dynamic gatekeeper, ensuring the subsequent costly dynamic execution phase is reliably targeted and executed. This guarantees a more universally resilient dependency resolution capability, moving beyond the inherent limitations of pure static inspection alone.II. Algorithmic Layer I: Lexical and Keyword HeuristicsThe first phase of bottom-up identification employs a rapid, foundational layer of analysis based on lexical heuristics. This layer provides high recall at minimal computational cost, serving as an efficient filter for the vast majority of non-manifest files (e.g., source code, documentation, images).2.1 Lexical Analysis: Tokenization and Feature ExtractionLexical analysis is the initial stage of processing, functioning similarly to the scanner in a compiler, where the high-level input program is converted into a structured sequence of tokens.5 This process is foundational for extracting raw features from text-based configuration files, identifying keywords, operators, and symbols characteristic of build scripts.5The critical task in this layer is the definition of high-value, dependency-related tokens specific to the manifest domain. For the C/C++ ecosystem, this includes identifying core CMake commands such as add_library (which defines a compilation output or target) 7 and find_package (which explicitly handles external dependency inclusion).8 Similarly, tokens indicative of Makefile structure, such as rule syntaxes and explicit compiler calls, are weighted heavily.2 More generally, tokens related to configuration, version strings, and file inclusion (version, include, export) are also valuable indicators of a file's orchestration role.102.2 Quantifying Manifest Density Score (MDS)To leverage these token features statistically, a tailored heuristic metric, the Manifest Density Score (MDS), must be computed. The MDS is based on the principle of Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). It quantifies the frequency of high-value build or dependency tokens within a single file (Term Frequency, TF) relative to the rarity of those tokens across the entire repository (Inverse Document Frequency, IDF).Heuristic approaches like MDS offer significant advantages in the initial screening phase. They provide simplicity, speed, low resource requirements, and high interpretability.11 The transparency of the MDS calculation allows engineers to easily calibrate detection thresholds and debug why a specific custom script was or was not flagged, thus maintaining flexibility.11 This rapid, low-cost calculation is essential for pruning millions of files, such as source code or documentation, before engaging the significantly costlier syntactic, structural, or machine learning analyses required in subsequent layers. The high MDS files are retained as the strong candidates for manifest classification.Table 1 provides a comparative overview of the core bottom-up detection paradigms, highlighting the role of Lexical Heuristics in establishing rapid initial filtering capabilities.Table 1: Comparative Analysis of Bottom-Up Detection ParadigmsParadigmPrimary MechanismKey Feature/OutputC/C++ Suitability (Variability)Computational CostLexical Heuristics (MDS)Keyword/Token Frequency Analysis 2Manifest Density Score (MDS)High (Keywords are reliable indicators)Low (Excellent for rapid filtering)Syntactic/Semantic AnalysisAST Fragment Analysis, Symbolic Evaluation 1Semantic Role Confirmation, Presence Condition MapHigh (Confirms command execution/logic)Moderate (Requires custom parsers)Graph CentralityRepository Dependency Graph (CKG) 14Structural Centrality Score (Hub/Nexus Identification) 15High (Role is structural, independent of syntax)High (Graph construction is intensive, but calculation is fast once built)Machine Learning (Embeddings)Semantic Similarity Search (Vector Database) 16File Role Classification Probability 17Moderate to High (Requires labeled data for training)Moderate (Fast inference, high initial training cost)III. Algorithmic Layer II: Syntactic and Semantic ValidationLayer II processes the high-MDS candidates from Layer I to validate whether the identified tokens are used correctly and meaningfully as commands or structural definitions, rather than simply appearing as data or comments. This layer moves beyond simple keyword counting to establish semantic fidelity.3.1 Syntactic Pattern Recognition and Grammar ModelingTo confirm that tokens serve a functional role, rather than merely existing in the text, syntactic analysis is required. While full parsing of every custom configuration script may be impractical, inferring the structure through partial Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) analysis or pattern recognition is necessary. This allows the system to confirm, for example, that the token add_library is being invoked with the command syntax required by CMake, thereby affirming its function as a build definition.7For languages with defined, yet highly non-standard, grammars (such as specialized Makefile dialects or customized shell configuration), tools derived from the Lex/Yacc lineage can be utilized to generate custom lexical analyzers and parsers.6 This enables the confirmation of the expected language structure, providing robust validation that minimizes false positives stemming from keyword collisions where a build keyword might appear coincidentally in a non-configuration file.3.2 Symbolic Execution for Configuration and Variability ExtractionA manifest file in a highly configured project must be capable of controlling variability. In systems like the Linux kernel, the build process dictates which files and features are compiled based on thousands of configuration options.1 A simple static reading of the dependency list may fail to capture these conditional dependencies.To address this, the analysis must adopt techniques traditionally found in program verification, such as symbolic execution.13 Research has demonstrated the feasibility of applying symbolic evaluation to build systems, specifically Makefiles (e.g., SYMake), to extract configuration knowledge.1 By treating build script execution symbolically, the analyzer tracks the flow of configuration variables (e.g., compiler flags, platform targets) rather than concrete values. This approach allows the system to determine the presence condition of every file or code fragment—the Boolean formula over configuration options that dictates whether that artifact is included in the final product.1By symbolically evaluating the build script, the engine moves beyond superficial pattern matching to extracting the definitive configuration map. This process confirms the file's role as a primary manifest not just through its content, but through its demonstrably complex management of configuration logic and its pervasive control over the system’s architecture. This capability is paramount for accurately identifying manifests in complex C/C++ projects, where configuration decisions are deeply embedded within the build files.Table 2 illustrates the key features that define a file as a manifest across different C/C++ build systems, informing the design of Layer II heuristics.Table 2: C/C++ Build Script Intrinsic Feature SignaturesBuild System ArtifactHigh-Value Lexical TokensCritical Syntactic DirectivesCharacteristic Graph RoleExample Semantic FunctionCMakeLists.txt (or custom name)find_package 8, add_library 7, target_link_libraries, projectFunction calls, Variable assignment (set())Central Build Target Hub, External Dependency ConnectorDefines compilation targets and links dependencies 19Makefile (or custom variant)all:, dependency syntax (.o:), compiler invocations (gcc, g++)Rules (target: dependencies 2), Phony targets (.PHONY)Core Orchestration Node, Explicit Dependency ListEnacts dependency-based builds and controls execution flow 2Custom Configuration Script (.sh, .py, .config)export, include, package manager calls (pip, apt-get)Environment variable setting, OS/Platform checks, string manipulation 10Utility/Setup Node, Environment Pre-processorPrepares the runtime or compilation environment before main build executionIV. Algorithmic Layer III: Graph-Theoretic Centrality and Structural Role DiscoveryThe third algorithmic layer provides a robust, language-agnostic mechanism to validate a file’s manifest role by analyzing its structural position within the repository’s architecture. This approach confirms the file's importance independent of its name or even minor syntax variations, focusing instead on its relational context.4.1 Constructing the Code Knowledge Graph (CKG)The Code Knowledge Graph (CKG) is an explicit model of the relationships existing across a repository.14 In this graph, nodes represent files, libraries, or compilation targets, and edges represent dependencies. These dependencies can be explicit (e.g., references defined within a manifest) or implicit (e.g., C++ source files including specific header files).20The manifest file is inherently essential for generating the project's dependency map.22 This structural requirement implies that any file correctly fulfilling the function of a manifest must occupy a position of significant centrality within the CKG. It acts as a primary nexus, connecting external dependencies to internal source files and linking various compilation modules together.4.2 Centrality Metrics for Hub IdentificationNetwork science provides formal tools to analyze complex structures and identify critical nodes.24 By applying centrality metrics to the CKG, the manifest’s status as an orchestration hub can be quantitatively confirmed.Degree Centrality: This metric measures the raw number of connections a file has. A manifest file is expected to exhibit a high out-degree, as it explicitly references numerous external packages or links many internal source and object files.7Betweenness Centrality: This metric quantifies how often a file lies on the shortest path between any two other files in the network. A top-level build script, such as a main CMakeLists.txt, often intermediates the dependency resolutions between module subdirectories and external libraries, resulting in a high betweenness score.Eigenvector Centrality: This advanced metric measures a node's influence based on its connections to other influential nodes. A high eigenvector score confirms that the candidate file links core components that are themselves highly connected, thus solidifying its identity as a critical architectural artifact.15The architectural role of a build script is structurally invariant across minor changes in implementation or language specifics. By combining high scores from the lexical (MDS) and syntactic (Symbolic Evaluation) layers with a high centrality score, the system gains a powerful, independent structural validation. This comprehensive assessment ensures that files flagged are genuinely central hubs in the repository's configuration, greatly reducing ambiguity in the classification process.15V. Machine Learning and Hybrid Classification ModelsFor highly generalized or customized configuration artifacts that defy rigid heuristic definition, Machine Learning (ML) models offer the necessary flexibility to classify files based on complex, non-linear patterns.5.1 Feature Engineering for ClassificationTraditional ML classifiers (such as Random Forest or Support Vector Machines) require a structured, quantitative representation of the file. This necessitates the creation of a hybrid feature vector that synthesizes data from the preceding analytical layers:Lexical Features: Including the MDS value and the frequency counts of the Top N domain-specific keywords.Syntactic Features: Quantifying structural elements derived from parsing, such as the count of conditional blocks, variable assignments, and command invocation density.Graph Features: Incorporating the centrality scores (Degree, Betweenness, Eigenvector) to represent the file’s architectural position.By training these classifiers on a large, labeled corpus of diverse build scripts (Make, CMake, Conan, etc.), the models can generalize structural similarities. ML is demonstrably effective at classifying documents and code based on content and structural features 17, allowing the system to classify new, custom build scripts with high accuracy based on learned functional patterns.125.2 Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for Semantic Role InferenceRecent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) provide an additional powerful vector for semantic classification. LLMs excel at text-based classification, understanding context, and handling nuanced text structures, capabilities that are highly relevant for interpreting configuration files.17 Furthermore, LLMs have shown potential in configuration validation tasks by interpreting subtle structural patterns and ensuring semantic correctness.27However, applying full LLM inference across every file in a large repository is computationally prohibitive due to latency and resource intensity.16 A strategic application of LLM capabilities is required to make the approach scalable.The efficient alternative is the use of specialized embedding models to generate vector representations of file content. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the code or configuration structure. By storing these vectors in a specialized vector database, the system can perform rapid semantic similarity searches against the embeddings of known, verified manifest files.16 This process is orders of magnitude faster than running complex text through a full transformer model and bypasses context window limitations associated with asking an LLM to process thousands of file contents simultaneously.16 This approach effectively scales the powerful semantic understanding inherent in NLP to handle repository-level volume, serving as a powerful, data-driven arbiter for highly ambiguous or complex configuration scripts.VI. Synthesis and Roadmap: The Dynamic Dependency Detection EngineThe implementation of robust, bottom-up detection necessitates a layered, funnel architecture. This design principle ensures scalability by minimizing computational cost; files are filtered quickly using inexpensive methods before being subjected to rigorous, costly validation steps.6.1 Proposal for a Multi-Layered, Hybrid Detection PipelineThe proposed architecture organizes the algorithmic layers into a sequential pipeline, prioritizing speed and cost efficiency:Table 3: Multi-Layered Dynamic Detection Pipeline ArchitecturePipeline LayerFunction / GoalInputOutputValidation MethodL1: FilteringHigh-recall, low-cost pruning of irrelevant files.All files in repository.List of high-MDS candidate files.Lexical Heuristics (MDS Score) 11L2: Semantic ValidationConfirm execution intent and extract configuration logic.L1 Candidate List.Syntactically/Semantically confirmed manifests.AST Fragment Analysis & Symbolic Evaluation 1L3: Structural ConfirmationVerify architectural role and criticality.L2 Confirmed Manifests (and linked source files).Final list of validated Manifest Hubs.Graph Centrality Metrics (Betweenness, Eigenvector) 15L4: Ambiguity ResolutionClassify low-confidence or highly customized scripts.Ambiguous L1/L2 candidates.Probability score of Manifest role.Vector Embedding/Semantic Search 16The detection process begins with Layer 1, where the Manifest Density Score rapidly filters the corpus. Candidates that pass this threshold proceed to Layer 2, where symbolic execution and partial parsing confirm the file’s intended semantic function as a controller of system logic and variability. Layer 3 provides an external, structural validation by confirming that the file acts as a central hub within the code dependency graph. Finally, Layer 4 provides a fallback mechanism, utilizing semantic embeddings for highly custom or ambiguous scripts that do not conform perfectly to established syntactic patterns but possess semantic similarity to known manifest types.6.2 Implementing and Managing the Heuristic RulebaseA critical aspect of this hybrid system is the management of the heuristic rulebase (Layers I and II). Because heuristics are based on predefined rules, they offer high interpretability and can be quickly adapted to changing technical environments.11 However, constant calibration is necessary.The operational reality of analyzing complex ecosystems dictates that continuous, collaborative feedback loops are necessary to manage emergent edge cases.3 The system must be designed to allow rapid iteration on the definition of high-value tokens and syntactic patterns based on developer domain knowledge. Furthermore, while the detection focuses on static artifacts, the output must be aligned with modern dependency management paradigms, such as the Dependency Submission API used by platforms like GitHub, which accommodates dependencies submitted from any package manager or custom ecosystem.22VII. Conclusions and RecommendationsThe successful transition from static, top-down detection to a dynamic, bottom-up heuristic engine for dependency manifest identification requires the integration of multiple, complimentary algorithmic layers. The core challenge in complex ecosystems like C/C++—variable naming and deeply embedded configuration logic—is addressed not by one technique, but by a multi-modal approach combining content analysis, semantic verification, and structural validation.The primary conclusion is that achieving universal reliability necessitates identifying the correct manifest files before executing the complex and unpredictable dynamic analysis required for full dependency resolution in compiled languages. The proposed Multi-Layered Hybrid Detection Pipeline serves as the essential static bootstrapper, reliably transforming unstructured repository content into a definitive list of build orchestrators.By implementing this architecture, the application achieves two strategic outcomes:Universal Reliability: The dynamic, bottom-up detection ensures that critical build file information is always surfaced, providing a comprehensive and resilient data foundation for the application’s core functions, irrespective of custom project naming conventions. This directly addresses the requirement for a universally reliable dependency section.Enhanced AI Architectural Understanding: The robust, validated data foundation produced by the pipeline—the confirmed manifestation of the codebase architecture via the Code Knowledge Graph and validated manifests—provides higher quality, grounded context. This reliable codebase map is critical for enhancing the capability of downstream AI models to understand project architecture, minimize context-related errors, and improve code intelligence without requiring constant, language-specific maintenance. The reliability of the output directly enhances the system’s overall autonomy.

Heuristic Manifest Detection vs. Static Lists
Traditional tools (e.g. GitHub’s dependency graph, Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check) rely on fixed filename conventions (e.g. package.json, pom.xml) to find dependency manifests. If a project uses a nonstandard name or location, these tools often miss it (for example, Snyk requires an explicit --file flag if the manifest isn’t in the root)[1][2]. Red Hat’s CodeReady plugin similarly “auto-detects” only standard default manifest names, otherwise requiring a user to supply the path[2]. In practice, this top-down approach breaks down for C/C++ ecosystems where build lists come in many forms (custom Makefiles, CMakeLists.txt, conanfile.py, etc.) and names vary. Bifolco et al. note that even GitHub’s automated graph has high error rates (over 27%) partly due to “oversimplified processing of manifest/lock files”[3].
By contrast, bottom-up methods inspect a file’s contents and structure to guess its role. Conceptually, one scans a repository for files that look like dependency definitions, using intrinsic cues (keywords, syntax, patterns) instead of fixed names. In software composition analysis (SCA) practice, this is acknowledged: for example, AboutCode notes that one SCA technique is “scanning a codebase to identify components (packages), based on the structure of the codebase, the content of the files and any available metadata”[4]. In other words, files are flagged as manifests if they contain typical package metadata or dependency declarations.
Content-Based and Structural Heuristics
A variety of heuristics can be employed:
• Keyword and pattern matching: Search file contents for characteristic terms. For instance, many manifest-like files contain words like “dependencies”, “version”, “find_package” (CMake), “include” (Make), or structured tags (e.g. <groupId> in a Maven POM). If a text or script file has many such indicators at a significantly higher density than typical source code, it may be a manifest. For example, a Python conanfile.py often defines class attributes like requires = [ ... ]; a regex looking for requires\s*=\s*[ could flag it. Similarly, a CMakeLists might be recognized by the presence of project(...), add_library, or target_link_libraries, which rarely occur together in non-build files.
• Syntax/grammar recognition: Attempt to parse the file under known manifest grammars. For example, try parsing as JSON, YAML, XML, or Python AST. If it is valid JSON and contains top-level fields like "dependencies" or "package" (common in npm, Yarn, or Composer manifests), that’s strong evidence. If it parses as XML and has <dependencies> elements (Maven POM) or as TOML with [dependencies] (Rust/Cargo), that’s a clue. Even more flexibly, a system could note: “this file is valid JSON or YAML and it has a top-level key matching known manifest fields => likely manifest.” For CMake, one could use a simple parser or even heuristic splitting on whitespace to see if it has typical CMake commands.
• Structural/graph clues: Some manifest files implicitly define dependency graphs. For instance, a Maven POM lists <dependency> entries, which form edges in a dependency graph. A heuristic engine might count such edges or build a mini-graph: if the file has many find_package commands referencing external libs, it likely is a build manifest. In C/C++ projects, one could look at #include graphs in source code and trace back: often, the “root” files that lead to many includes (e.g. a top-level header list in a Makefile) might be manifest candidates. More generally, static analysis (call/inclusion graph construction) can hint at critical configuration files. For example, static slicing or call-graph analysis of a build script might show it ultimately invokes compiler commands – then that script is central. (In practice, doing full AST slicing on arbitrary build scripts is complex, but conceptually it is an analog to program impact analysis[5].)
• Machine learning / statistical classification: One could train a model on labeled repositories (manifest vs. non-manifest files). Feature vectors might include token n-grams, presence of certain words, file length, or parse trees. For example, one could treat each file as a “bag of words” and train a classifier. (Studies like “What’s the Code?” show this is feasible for language/topic classification[6], and similar NLP on code could be applied.) To our knowledge, there is no published ML model specifically for manifest-detection, but this is a plausible research direction. Large language models (e.g. CodeBERT, GPT) could be fine-tuned to label files by role, though at present we found no open literature on that exact application.
• Combined heuristics: In practice, tools often combine these. For example, ScanCode toolkit (an open-source SCA scanner) uses a classifier plugin that marks files as is_manifest=true when they resemble known manifest formats[7]. The exact internal logic is not public, but ScanCode’s documentation defines is_manifest as “True if this file is likely a package manifest file such as a Maven pom.xml or an npm package.json”[7]. This suggests it checks content patterns (since it does not know the filename). The FOSDEM description of ScanCode emphasizes that it “provides best-in-class… package manifest detection”[8], indicating that some heuristic rules or signature scanning are used under the hood. In short, ScanCode exemplifies an open-source tool already moving in this bottom-up direction: it does analyze file content rather than just names[8][7].
Open-Source Tools and Academic Insights
Beyond ScanCode, few tools explicitly advertise purely content-based manifest finding. Most SCA utilities still rely on extension lists or user hints. For example, Red Hat’s CodeReady Action auto-detects only default manifest filenames and otherwise expects the user to set the path[2]. Snyk similarly scans default locations and fails to find any “in non-standard locations” unless directed[1]. OWASP Dependency-Check focuses on scanning identified manifests for vulnerabilities, not on discovering new ones by content. In academia, work has mostly gone into related areas: analyzing development history (e.g. mining co-change patterns to infer dependencies[9]) or static code analysis for program dependencies[5], rather than manifest identification per se.
One notable effort is Macaron (Oracle Labs) which looks at GitHub Actions workflows to extract build commands. While not manifest-specific, it does show the value of deep analysis of workflow syntax and dataflow to identify build specs[10]. By analogy, one could imagine scanning CI configs or scripts for clues about manifests. But Macaron’s focus is on Java/Maven and CI steps, not on generic manifest classification. We did not find any published ML or data-mining studies specifically on manifest-file classification.
On the academic side, software composition analysis literature (beyond SCA vendors) emphasizes the importance of scanning code and metadata. The AboutCode team explicitly notes that identifying components often comes down to scanning code content and metadata fields[4]. This is a conceptual validation: the community recognizes that content analysis (rather than static filename lists) is part of future SCA. However, they mostly discuss this at the level of component discovery, not an algorithmic solution. In summary, the closest concrete approaches are the heuristic classifiers in tools like ScanCode[8][7] and rule-based parsing of known manifest syntaxes. No comprehensive academic “blueprint” for bottom-up manifest detection appears published.
Towards a Bottom-Up Detection Engine
In building a heuristic engine for manifests, one could combine the above ideas. For each file in a repo, check: does it parse as JSON/XML/YAML/Python/TOML etc., and if so, does it contain keys or constructs typical of package metadata? Does it reference many external modules or libraries (keywords like depends, requires, target_link)? Compute a score based on keyword density and structural cues. Potentially augment with trained classifiers on token patterns. Files exceeding a threshold would be marked as candidate manifests. Graph analysis could further refine this: e.g., confirm that treating the file as a manifest yields a coherent dependency graph of other files or packages. All these analyses can be implemented in an open-source manner: e.g. ScanCode’s patterns are open, and commoncode libraries support parsing many file types.
To our knowledge, no existing open-source project already embodies a fully dynamic, language-agnostic manifest detector. (ScanCode comes closest but is largely rule-based.) We found no academic paper explicitly tackling this “manifest discovery” problem. The cited ScanCode docs provide concrete motivation and definitions[11][7], and reports like Bifolco et al. show why better detection matters[3]. These sources suggest the gap: current practice assumes known manifest names, which fails in complex ecosystems. Our survey suggests that a heuristic/content-based engine is feasible but would involve stitching together many pattern- and syntax-checks (e.g. JSON schema checks, AST parsing of scripts, keyword heuristics).
Sources: In particular, ScanCode documentation classifies and defines is_manifest by content[7][11]; AboutCode’s SCA primer emphasizes scanning file content and metadata for components[4]. In contrast, industry tools like Snyk and CodeReady rely on filename conventions[1][2]. Recent empirical studies confirm that naive manifest use leads to errors[3]. These observations motivate developing new content-driven methods as described above.
